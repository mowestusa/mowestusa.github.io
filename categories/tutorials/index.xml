      <description>Eventually the experienced FOSS user will discover tiling window managers. Similar to fluxbox, tiling window managers are light weight on resources, but they might need additional customization to enable features that come turned on automatically in desktop environments like Gnome, Plasma, Mate, and XFCE. Tiling window managers include FOSS like Awesome, Xmonad, i3, and herbstluftwm just to name a few. Tiling window managers use keyboard shortcuts to quickly arrange your program windows into tiled layouts to make the most of your screen real estate.</description>

      <description>When you hang around technology enthusiasts who love to be productive on their computers, you might hear the term &amp;ldquo;workflow.&amp;rdquo; Workflows tend to be as different as the individuals who establish their personal workflow. In FOSS communities individuals will sing their praises of their desktop environment often because they like its default workflow or it fits their preferred workflow. Perhaps, I&amp;rsquo;m an odd duck, but I have found &amp;ldquo;workflows&amp;rdquo; that work for me in all the major desktop environments.</description>
