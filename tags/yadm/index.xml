      <description>Running a Linux distribution as your computer&amp;rsquo;s operating system opens up a world of tweaks, configurations, and personalizations. FOSS offers choices in desktop environments, window managers, and favorite programs. All these choices enable you to set up a computer environment that serves your unique needs. What happens when you want to recreate that same experience on a 2nd or 3rd computer that is also running a Linux distribution? You can manually copy each of your configuration files from one computer to another using a folder connected to syncthing or a USB flash drive transferred with sneakernet.</description>
